        <p>With an an Engineering major in Integrated Design and Media at NYU, 
            I have had the privilege to obtain both: analytical and creative skills that make me a unique thinker, quick problem solver and efficient collaborator.
            I have a deep passion for both the world of media/design which is seen with my artistic vision, and engineering I've pursued at Tandon. 
            I would like to keep applying them to tangible projects, but I'm also a very curious person who is always seeking to learn more as I explore new paths.
