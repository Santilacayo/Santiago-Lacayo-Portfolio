        <p>This project is a full recreation of the audio of the cooking scene from Ratatouille when Remy the rat cooks for the first time in the restaurant after Linguini screwed the soup. It consists of over 20 different sound effects and music tracks. In the movie, this scene heavily relies on sound, as it sets the mood of a French restaurant through its use of music. But I gave it a little twist by using music from my country to set a different mood</p>
